NAME
----
fam_atomic_128_swap - 128 bit fam atomic swap

SYNOPSIS
--------
....
#include <fam_atomic.h>

void
fam_atomic_128_swap(int64_t *address,
		    int64_t value[2],
		    int64_t result[2]);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Given 'address', which is a pointer to a 128 bit fam atomic 
variable, reads the contents of the atomic variable,
sets the variable to 'value', and stores the original value
that was read into 'result'.

'value' and 'result' are both arrays of two 64 bit integers
representing 128 bit variables, where index [0] represents the
first 64 bits and index [1] represents the last 64 bits.

RETURN VALUE
------------
None, the previous value gets stored in 'result'.
