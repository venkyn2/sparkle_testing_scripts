NAME
----
fam_atomic_32_compare_store - 32 bit fam atomic compare and store

SYNOPSIS
--------
....
#include <fam_atomic.h>

int32_t
fam_atomic_32_compare_store(int32_t *address,
			    int32_t compare,
			    int32_t store);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Given 'address', which is a pointer to a 32 bit fam atomic 
variable, reads the contents of the atomic variable and
checks if it is equal to 'compare'. If true, the variable
gets set to 'store'. If false, the variable does not get
modified. Returns the original value that was read.

After calling this function, applications would typically
check if the return value is equivalent to 'compare' to
verify if the operation succeeded.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns the previous value of the fam atomic.
