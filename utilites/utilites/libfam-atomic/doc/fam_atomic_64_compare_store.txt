NAME

fam_atomic_64_compare_store - 64 bit fam atomic compare and store

SYNOPSIS
--------
....
#include <fam_atomic.h>

int64_t
fam_atomic_64_compare_store(int64_t *address,
			    int64_t compare,
			    int64_t store);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Given 'address', which is a pointer to a 64 bit fam atomic 
variable, reads the contents of the atomic variable and
checks if it is equal to 'compare'. If true, the variable gets
set to 'store'. If false, the variable does not get modified.
Returns the original value that was read.

After calling this function, applications would typically
check if the return value is equivalent to 'compare' to
verify if the operation succeeded.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns the previous value of the fam atomic.
