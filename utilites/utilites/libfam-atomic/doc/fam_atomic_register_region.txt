NAME
----
fam_atomic_register_region - registers FAM area with the library

SYNOPSIS
--------
....
#include <fam_atomic.h>

int fam_atomic_register_region(void *region_start,
			       size_t region_length,
			       int fd,
			       off_t offset);

cc ... -lfam_atomic

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Memory regions containing fam atomics and/or fam locks must be
registered using some of the parameters from the mmap operation
before any of the atomics or locks within the region can be used.
It is recommended that this gets called right after the mmap
operation to register the entire mapped region.

region_start: Pointer to start of region. This is usually the
value that was returned by mmap().

region_length: Size of the region. Should match value given
to mmap().

fd: The file descriptor associated with the region. Should match
the fd given to mmap().

offset: The offset between the start of the file and 'region_start'.
Should match offset value given to mmap().

RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns 0 on success. On failure, returns -1 and sets
errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
------
*ENOMEM* Not enough memory for the library to allocate the metadata
         required for tracking the registered region.
